My solution to the freeCodeCamp cat and dog image classifier project (part of the course 'Machine Learning with Python'):

Using a rather simple CNN, I reach an accuracy of 70% on the test set. Some experimentations were necessary and I am sure that further improvements can still be achieved without having to increase the NN significantly.
